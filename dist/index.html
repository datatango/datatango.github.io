Hello there, thanks for stopping by.
</p> <p class="text-zinc-400 leading-relaxed mb-4">
I am a developer, filmmaker, preservationist, and technologist living in
    Chicago.
</p> <p class="text-zinc-400 leading-relaxed mb-4">
Currently, I'm the Digital Preservation Specialist at the University of
    Chicago, where I contribute to UChicagoNode, an integrated digital
    collections platform that brings together digital materials across the
    University's library's collections. Additionally, I co-chair the
    International Image Interoperability Framework (IIIF) Audio/Video Community
    Group.
</p> <p class="text-zinc-400 leading-relaxed mb-4">
Previously, I’ve worked in digital preservation, film restoration, and media
    preservation at institutions including the Asian Film Archive, City
    University of New York Television (CUNY TV), and the J. Paul Getty Trust.
    I’ve also completed internships at Bay Area Video Coalition, Cineric Inc.,
    Internet Archive, New York Public Library, and Prelinger Archives while
    earning my M.A. in Moving Image Archiving and Preservation at New York
    University’s Tisch School of the Arts.
</p> <p class="text-zinc-400 leading-relaxed mb-4">
Originally from sunny Singapore, I enjoy grocery shopping, sailing, and the
    smell of fresh bread.
