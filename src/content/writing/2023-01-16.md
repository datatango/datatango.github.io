Hello

This site has undergone a noticeable refresh to include a _work_ page as a reflecion of my renewed commitment towards writing more about my work and learnings gleaned from my graduate studies, which I've embarked on since September 2022. 2022 was a productive year of change that took me away from the maintenance of this site, hence the lack of updates. But I intend to correct his by documenting the projects I've embarked on and the challenges I've faced along the way.

I love the new [theme's](https://github.com/nicoelayda/celeste) simple design that focuses on the site's content. Migration of the posts from the previous theme and its visual assets was a breeze - altogether a fairly straightforward process which took less than 10 minutes.

The set up of Google Analytics was however a pain, and I wrote a short post on its set up [here](/writing/2023-01-17).
