I recently had to provide a list of files in a USB thumbdrive/stick and learned a sweet trick via CLI. This method provides a text, Word, or Excel file that lists all the files and folders inside a specific directory within your computer.

## Basic command structure

**Syntax:**

```bash
DIR [pathname(s)] [display_format] [file_attributes] [sorted] [time] [options]
```

**Example:**

```bash
dir /s > output.doc
```

**Flags explained:**
- `dir` - Lists all files and folders contained in the folder
- `/s` - Lists all files in the subfolders as well
- `output.doc` - The output file containing the directory listing (can also be `.txt` for editing in Notepad)

## Listing only certain types of files

To filter specific file types, use wildcards:

```bash
dir /s *.pdf > output_pdf.doc
```

**What this does:**
- `*.pdf` - Wildcard function that selects only `.pdf` files

## List bare format (no heading, sizes or summary)

The `/b` switch lists file names only. When displaying subfolders with `dir /b /s`, the command will return a full pathname.

```bash
dir /b /s > output_pdf.doc
```

## Using the `tree` command instead of `dir`

This command produces a tree listing of the current directory:

```bash
tree /f > output.txt
```

**Flags explained:**
- `/f` - Displays the names of files within each directory listed
- `/a` - Uses alternative (ASCII) characters to draw the tree diagram, useful for printers that don't support line and box drawing characters
