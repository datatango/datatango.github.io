I never realized WSL does not natively allow Windows users to access a USB drive in the system for reasons unknown to me.

However, it can be configured.

1\. Create a mount point:

```bash
mkdir /mnt/a
```

The directory's name does not matter.

2\. Mount the desired drive letter to the newly created directory.

```bash
sudo mount -t drvfs A: /mnt/a
```
