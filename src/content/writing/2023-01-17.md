This post covers the set up of Google Analytics for GitHub Pages.

1\. Go to Google Analytics and create a Google Analytics account for the site you would like to track.

2\. Take note of the tracking ID and copy the code snippet provided that looks like the following:

```html
<script
  async
  src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=UA-XXXXXXXXX-X"
></script>
<script>
  window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];
  function gtag() {
    dataLayer.push(arguments);
  }
  gtag("js", new Date());

  gtag("config", "UA-XXXXXXXXX-X");
</script>
```

3\. Create a new .HTML file in the _\_includes_ folder that contains the code snippet and name it **google_analytics.html**.

4\. Add the following code to your default layout: \_layouts/default.html.

```liquid
{% raw %}
{% include google_analytics.html %}
{% endraw %}
```
