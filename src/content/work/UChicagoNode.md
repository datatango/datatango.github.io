I'm part of an incredible team building UChicagoNode (Node) — the University of Chicago Library's unified open-access discovery platform for digital collections.

My current focus is evaluating the performance of IIIF image servers and open-source image processing tools across digital image formats including JPEG2000, TIFF, and pyramidal TIFF. This study directly informs the architecture of Node's IIIF image delivery pipeline.

Based on these findings, I'm reprocessing several of the Library's legacy digital collections to make them IIIF-ready for Node, including digitized maps, books, and photographic glass plates.

Stay tuned.
