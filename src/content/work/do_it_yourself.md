__Do It Yourself No. 3: A Guide to the Preservation of Optical Media (CDs and DVDs) for Artists and Filmmakers__ is a practical, Spanish-language publication created to support artists, filmmakers, and cultural workers in caring for audiovisual and digital materials stored on optical discs. Developed in collaboration with the Audiovisual Preservation Exchange (APEX) at New York University and the Cinemateca de Bogotá, with support from Idartes and Colombia’s Ministry of Culture, the guide is part of the Do It Yourself series—an initiative focused on making preservation knowledge accessible beyond traditional archival institutions.

The guide addresses the vulnerabilities of CDs and DVDs, from material degradation to technological obsolescence, and offers clear, actionable strategies for organizing, stabilizing, and extracting content from these everyday formats.
