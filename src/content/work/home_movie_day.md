In 2022, I organized Singapore’s first Home Movie Day with the generous support of Momo Film Co., alongside a generous community of collaborators and friends (listed below).

Across the weekend of 13–14 August 2022, we screened a curated programme of home movies from Singapore, spanning works from the 1960s to contemporary pieces. The screenings also included short films by experimental filmmakers Gözde and Russel Zehnder, situating personal filmmaking within a broader experimental context.

Kodak generously supported the event by providing Super 8 film stock, enabling us to support eight filmmakers, each of whom produced a new film specially for Home Movie Day Singapore 2022. Many of which went on to screen at international film festivals.

In addition, a Super 8 workshop was held, where participants learned to shoot and hand-process their own films. These films were then projected during the closing programme, bringing the weekend full circle—from home movies of the past to newly created works shared collectively.
