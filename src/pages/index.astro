    Hello, and thanks for stopping by.
  </p>

  <p class="text-zinc-200 leading-relaxed mb-4">
    I'm a programmer, preservationist, and filmmaker living in Chicago.
  </p>

  <p class="text-zinc-200 leading-relaxed mb-4">
    I started my career as a <HoverImage src="work/intro/dit.jpg">
      digital imaging technician and camera assistant</HoverImage
    > for film & TV, working through the industry's transition from film to digital.
    After working on numerous shorts, features, and commercials, I turned to <HoverImage
      src="writing/nypl/nypl_1.jpeg">film preservation</HoverImage
    > after learning in a film history class that many films from
    Singapore's Golden Age had been lost. Since then, I've focused on applying technical
    and computational approaches to digital and media preservation, and open access
    for cultural heritage.
  </p>

  <p class="text-zinc-200 leading-relaxed mb-4">
    I'm currently the Digital Preservation Specialist at the University of
    Chicago, where I contribute to UChicagoNode, an integrated digital
    collections platform bringing together materials across the library's
    holdings and beyond. I also co-chair the International Image
    Interoperability Framework (IIIF) Audio/Video Community Group.
  </p>

  <p class="text-zinc-200 leading-relaxed mb-4">
    Previously, I’ve worked in digital and media preservation and film
    restoration at the Asian Film Archive, CUNY TV, and the J. Paul Getty Trust
    (The Getty). I’ve also completed internships at the Bay Area Video
    Coalition, Cineric Inc., Internet Archive, New York Public Library, and
    Prelinger Archives while earning my M.A. in Moving Image Archiving and
    Preservation from New York University’s Tisch School of the Arts.
  </p>

  <p class="text-zinc-200 leading-relaxed mb-4">
    Originally from sunny Singapore, I enjoy cycling, sailing, and the smell of
    fresh bread.
