    Hello, and thanks for stopping by.
  </p>

  <p class="text-zinc-200 leading-relaxed mb-4">
    I'm a programmer, media preservationist, and filmmaker living in Chicago.
  </p>

  <p class="text-zinc-200 leading-relaxed mb-4">
    I started my career as a digital imaging technician and camera assistant for
    film & TV, working through the industry's transition from film to digital.
    After numerous shorts, features, and commercials, I moved on to film
    preservation after I learnt in a film history class that a significant
    number of films from Singapore's Golden Age no longer exist. Since then,
    I've focused on applying technical and computational approaches to media
    preservation, restoration, and open access for cultural heritage.
  </p>

  <p class="text-zinc-200 leading-relaxed mb-4">
    I'm currently the Digital Preservation Specialist at the University of
    Chicago, where I contribute to UChicagoNode, an integrated digital
    collections platform bringing together materials across the library's
    holdings. I also co-chair the International Image Interoperability Framework
    (IIIF) Audio/Video Community Group.
  </p>

  <p class="text-zinc-200 leading-relaxed mb-4">
    Previously, I've worked in digital preservation, film restoration, and media
    archiving at the Asian Film Archive, CUNY TV, and the J. Paul Getty Trust.
    I've also completed internships at Bay Area Video Coalition, Cineric Inc.,
    Internet Archive, New York Public Library, and Prelinger Archives. I earned
    my M.A. in Moving Image Archiving and Preservation from New York
    University's Tisch School of the Arts.
  </p>

  <p class="text-zinc-200 leading-relaxed mb-4">
    Originally from sunny Singapore, I enjoy biking, sailing, and the
    smell of fresh bread.
